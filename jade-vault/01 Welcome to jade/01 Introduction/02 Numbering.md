id: numbering-and-ids

### Numbering
You may have noticed that ALL files and directories have a **number** in front of them.
That is **NOT** their id: that is merely a number to make sure things can be correctly sorted on the server.
Make sure every course, chapter and page has a number to identify.
The number can be of any length, as long as it is consistent.

### IDs
Every file **MUST** have an ID or it won't be considered.
If your vault is correctly setup, a random id should be automatically assigned via the Templating plugin,
but you can always add your own id (for example if you like _slugs_ more than _codes_)

Consider IDs constant, as they should **NEVER** be changed after publishing your changes.
